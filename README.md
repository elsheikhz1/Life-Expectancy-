# Life-Expectancy-
# Business problem
The problem addressed in the business context is to develop a regression model that analyzes the factors influencing life expectancy across 193 countries from 2000 to 2015. The goal is to identify the key predictors that significantly impact life expectancy, taking into account immunization, mortality, economic, and social factors. The study aims to fill the gap left by previous research, which did not adequately consider the influence of immunization and human development index, and often relied on single-year data, potentially overlooking long-term trends.

Additionally, the presence of missing data, particularly in variables such as population, Hepatitis B, and GDP, poses a challenge to the analysis. Some less-known countries lacked sufficient data, making it difficult to include them in the final dataset. Managing missing data is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the regression model's outcomes.

The ultimate objective is to provide actionable insights to countries, suggesting areas where they should focus their efforts and resources to efficiently improve the life expectancy of their populations. By understanding the significant factors contributing to life expectancy variations, governments and global health organizations can design targeted interventions and policies, potentially leading to better health outcomes worldwide.
# Data Collection and Preparation:
We sourced the data from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) and supplemented it with economic data from the United Nations website. The dataset consists of health-related factors deemed critical for analysis, carefully selected to ensure representativeness. Over the 15-year study period, significant advancements in the health sector have resulted in improved human mortality rates, particularly in developing nations. This progress is especially noteworthy when compared to the past three decades.
# Recommendation:
Based on the regression results, we can draw the following insights to improve life expectancy across countries:

Focus on Reducing Infant and Under-Five Deaths: Efforts to decrease infant and under-five mortality rates can have a significant positive impact on life expectancy.

Address Adult Mortality: Implement strategies to tackle adult mortality, as it strongly influences life expectancy.

Encourage Responsible Alcohol Consumption: Promote awareness and policies for responsible alcohol consumption, as it appears to have a positive association with life expectancy.

Improve Immunization Coverage: Enhance immunization programs to combat diseases like measles and polio, which have a negative impact on life expectancy.

Combat Incidents of HIV: Implement effective measures to reduce HIV incidents, as it is negatively correlated with life expectancy.

Strengthen Healthcare Infrastructure in Developing Countries: Developing economies should focus on enhancing their healthcare infrastructure and services to improve life expectancy.

Consider Regional Differences: Tailor health interventions based on specific regional needs, considering the impact of regional factors on life expectancy.

Monitor and Address Economic Status: Economically developed and developing countries should continue monitoring and improving their economic status to support better health outcomes.

Pay Attention to Time Trends: Identify and address time-specific factors affecting life expectancy to stay proactive in improving health outcomes.

It is essential to note that these recommendations should be considered alongside other factors, such as cultural, social, and environmental aspects, for a comprehensive approach to improving life expectancy globally.
